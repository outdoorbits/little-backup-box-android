# Fan

## Raspberry Pi 5
The Raspberry Pi Active Cooler for Raspberry Pi 5 is cheap, easy to install and maybe it brings best performance for your Raspberry Pi 5.

## General
Fans are usually designed for 5V power supply. A PWN-controlled fan is recommended. This can then be configured in the config menu. Connect the fan to pin 2 or 4 (5V), to one of the ground pins and - if using a pwm fan - to the selected pin. Default for pwm is GPIO 18 (pin 12).<br>
