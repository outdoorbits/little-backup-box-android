# Hardware

## Raspberry Pi
Because of the advantage of USB 3.0 Raspberry Pi 4 Modell B is recommended. It shouldn't make a big difference whether you use the 2GB, 4GB or 8GB variant here.<br>
Some other Raspberry Pi's were successfully tested. So far, only the Raspberry Pi 1 has proven to be really unusably slow, at least if you want to use a display.<br>
Unfortunately, there are no reports about other single-board computers. Experiences are welcome to be reported in the discussions.<br>

| Computer              | Experience |
|-----------------------|------------|
|Raspberry Pi 4 Model B |No problems with all variants|
|Raspberry Pi 3 Model B |About half the copying speed compared to the Raspberry Pi 4 thanks to USB 2.0|
|Raspberry Pi zero 2 W with USB Hubs HAT|About half the copying speed compared to the Raspberry Pi 4 thanks to USB 2.0|
|Raspberry Pi zero with USB Hubs HAT|Slow responding web GUI, even lower copying speed compared to the Raspberry Pi zero 2 W|

## Compatibility
Camera manufacturers sometimes format memory cards in proprietary formats, which can make handling difficult. On the other hand, there are also mass storage devices that cannot be operated directly on the Raspberry Pi in a stable manner, for example because of their high power consumption.
Basically, however, it can be assumed that almost all camera models and almost all storage devices can be operated with the Little-Backup-Box, albeit with a little effort.
The compatibility list is a start and will grow with every feedback.

### Cameras
| Manufacturer  | Model  | via cardreader  | Camera/direct  | Comment  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|DJI|DJI Mini 2|yes|?||
|GoPro|Hero5|yes|?||
|GoPro|Hero8|yes|?||
| Nikon  | Z6  | yes  | yes  | The energy requirement can be too high for the Raspberry pi and especially for weak power supplies, especially in combination with energy-intensive storage media (backup target). A generously dimensioned power supply unit (> 5V / 3A) or, even better, a powered hub enable stable use.  |
|Olympus|E‑M1 Mark II|yes|?||

## Useful accessories
### Travel HUBs
Some devices have an energy requirement that exceeds the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi 4. Problems occurred mainly in connection with XQD and CFExpress cards. Powerd USB hubs can enable reliable operation.

[ORICO 4-Port USB3.0 HUB](https://www.orico.shop/de/usb-30-hub-mit-4-usb-a-anschluessen-zusaetzliches.html)
is powered by USB-c and works very well with XQD-Cardreaders.

[UGREEN 4-Port USB 3.0 HUB](https://www.ugreen.com/products/4-ports-usb-3-0-hub)
is not tested yet
