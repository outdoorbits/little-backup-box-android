# VPN

You can use a VPN to gain secure access to your private network from outside. You can also transfer data in encrypted form, bypassing any local restrictions.<br>

WireGuard and OpenVPN connections can be configured under Settings - VPN.<br>
For this purpose, among other things, the respective configuration file must be uploaded. This is menu-driven and hopefully can be set up intuitively.<br>
Setting up a VPN server and setting up the configuration files can be much more complicated. Some routers offer the option of setting up VPN access. Then you can usually get a working client configuration file directly from your router.<br>
If you want or need to set up your own VPN server, [https://www.pivpn.io/](https://www.pivpn.io/) can be of great help.<br>
<br>
If a VPN connection is configured and activated, it is established over the network immediately before the relevant backup and immediately disconnected after the backup is complete. If it is not possible to establish the VPN connection, the backup will not be carried out.<br>
**Attention: If the VPN connection breaks down during the backup, the backup could possibly take place via an unprotected connection!**<br>
<br>
Depending on the configuration of the VPN network, you may not be able to access the Little Backup Box as long as the VPN connection is active. You may be able to gain access by logging into the same VPN with your device.<br>

**Please test your configuration very carefully before you want to use VPN when travelling.**<br>
