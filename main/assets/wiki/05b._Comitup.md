# Operation - Comitup

## General
Comitup is a very well maintained project, many thanks to Dave Steele. More information at [http://davesteele.github.io/comitup/](http://davesteele.github.io/comitup/).

## For WiFis with password protection
In the simplest case, a WiFi is completely open or protected with a password. In both cases, Comitup provides convenient help:
Proceed as follows to set up the first connection:
1. Connect your smartphone to the LBB hotspot
2. Visit http://10.41.0.1
3. Select the desired WiFi network there
4. Enter the access data
5. LBB will now connect to WiFi. LBB gets a new IP
6. Comitup remembers the last access data (only) and will automatically try to log into this WiFi in the future

If no second WiFi adapter is connected, the connection to the smartphone will be lost now. The new IP will be emailed within a minute - if configured. Alternatively, the IP can also be shown on the display. If there are control buttons, the IP can also be requested via the display menu.
Now navigate to https://my.new.lbb.ip, for example https://192.168.178.55 to reach the lbb web ui.

## For WiFis with portal side
Access to many WiFis is not password-protected. Before online access, however, access data must be entered on a portal page and/or conditions must be agreed to.
**A second WiFi adapter is required to overcome this hurdle.**
1. Log on to the WiFi as described under "For WiFis with password protection".
2. One of the two adapters is now connected to the WiFi.
3. The other WiFi adapter is still active as an LBB hotspot so that the connection to the smartphone is maintained
4. Go to the WiFi portal page with the smartphone browser and complete the registration
5. This will likely need to be repeated for each login

## iPhones and Android phones
These devices may not allow access to the addresses http://10.41.0.1 and https://10.41.0.1 without additional steps. The only exception seems to be the Comitup captive portal (also accessible via http://10.41.0.1).

Some browsers (but not all) do allow access, however, if there is no other active internet connection at the same time. If you experience connection problems with the Little Backup Box, try disabling your mobile data.

One possible explanation is that these devices do not forward requests to a hotspot if it does not offer an internet connection â€” at least as long as there is an alternative with internet access. As long as there is an alternative connection, this will be preferred.

In this context, it would make sense for these devices to make an exception for captive portals, as this could help establish the connection.
