# LBB Scanner Android app
Android app to find a Little Backup Box on the local network

This app searches for an active Little Backup Box connected to the same local network. It tries the last digit of the IP address and provides links to the devices found.

Please note: This only works if the LBB software is on or after June 1, 2025.
